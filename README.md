## 🚀 Overview
Cart King is a technical showcase of **Relational Database Management** and **MVC Architecture**. It features a robust backend powered by PostgreSQL and Entity Framework Core, handling everything from product categorization to simulated order processing.

The aim of this project is to showcase my progression as a Junior developer, displaying my ability to interact with a modern tech stack and hopefully cement confidence in my productivity and suitability to a development team.



Aims

* Understanding design-time tooling for Ef core migrations to run using an admin connection and app user
* Database Schema Design - Implementing C# classes that define the database structure
* Developing experience using Queries,
* and so much more - honestly the amount I have learned is monumental and I have made sure to include everything in my notes for future projects 



## ✨ Planned Features

- 🛍️ Product listing with rich descriptions, multiple photos & categories
- 👤 User registration & authentication (email confirmation, password reset)
- 🛒 Shopping cart & persistent cart (saved between sessions)
- 💳 Checkout process (currently simulated – ready for payment gateway integration)
- ⭐ Buyer & seller ratings / reviews
- 🔍 Advanced search & filtering (category, price range, condition, location...)
- 📱 Responsive design (mobile-friendly layout)
- 🛡️ Basic security features (anti-forgery, input validation, HTTPS ready)
- 👑 Admin panel (product moderation, user management, statistics)
